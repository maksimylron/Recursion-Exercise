# Recursion-Exercise

Showcase the power of recursion and iterative algorithm over doing for loops.

Total code run time of only **~6minutes**, from download of ~1 year of data to compilation of ~18000 csv files (each for demand and PV gen).

Executed Steps:

    Gather data files from http://nemweb.com.au/Reports/, specifically;
        operational demand (http://nemweb.com.au/Reports/ARCHIVE/Operational_Demand/ACTUAL_HH/)
        rooftop PV actual generation (http://nemweb.com.au/Reports/ARCHIVE/ROOFTOP_PV/ACTUAL/)

    Automate extraction of files from a zip file inside a zip file.

    Save data from those files into one csv file, one for demand and one for PV generation.
